Hey there! Just a guy who thinks he can do something better than others—but hey, I’ve been right a few times. 😎

I'm a Computer Science sophomore who spends way too much time coding and not enough time drinking coffee (but I’m working on it). Currently, I’m juggling a few projects that are as cool as they sound: a grocery POS system that tracks prepaid accounts like a pro, a media streaming app that brings live audio and playlists to life, and a chat app where time capsules and interactive journals are the norm. If you’re wondering, yes, I do have a knack for creating fun tech that people actually want to use!

When I’m not buried in code, you’ll find me writing songs about love, life, and whatever else pops into my head (hopefully with some catchy hooks). I’m on the lookout for ways to turn my lyrics into music—no, I don’t know how, but I’m definitely going to figure it out.

When it comes to coding, I’m all about writing clean, efficient code that actually works the way it’s supposed to (I know, revolutionary, right?). But let’s be real—I’m also not afraid to get a little wild with my creativity. Whether I’m using Flask, Python, or something else I can pretend to be an expert in, I’m all about making things work _and_ making them fun. I mean, who wants a boring, functional app when you can have something that’s both useful _and_ makes you smile? I believe in building tools that people actually want to use, with real-time features and interfaces that are as engaging as a puppy in a sweater. Because let’s face it, tech should make life easier—and a whole lot more entertaining.

So yeah, I may think I can do better than others (because I totally can).

If you need someone who can code and tell a terrible (but lovable) joke, I’m your person. I’m always up for learning new things, building cool stuff, and collaborating with other creative minds. Let’s make something awesome!
